# Project Name: Regular-1-cocycle-HOMFLYPT-2cabled

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project.
The notebook (demo.ipynb) aims to use the quantum equations from pushing a twist and another tangle T2 to distinguish different knots. 

If you do not know how to run jupyter notebook in your own computer 
you can run it in colab online. The link is below:

The notebook begins with the definitions of a lot of functions (in the code part). 
Then there are several examples such as 6_1 and 6_2. 

There are several packages need to install listed in requirements.txt
If you have not yet install these packages, you can insert a cell in the notebook
and write the following and run this cell. 

!pip install numpy
!pip install sympy
!pip install tqdm
!pip install numba
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install regina
